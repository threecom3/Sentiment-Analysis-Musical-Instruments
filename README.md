# Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews of Musical Instruments

## Overview
This project focuses on the sentiment analysis of user reviews for musical instruments, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Logistic Regression, and Na誰ve Bayes models to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments based on user ratings from one to five stars.

## Models and Methodology
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Used for text classification to capture complex patterns in user reviews, achieving an accuracy of 68%.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied for binary classification of sentiments, achieving an accuracy of 71%.
- **Na誰ve Bayes**: Implemented as a baseline model, which achieved an accuracy of 28%.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Prediction Tool**: Allows users to input their reviews and get instant sentiment analysis results.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the distribution of sentiments based on ratings.

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved an average accuracy of 71%.
- CNN model reached 68% accuracy.
- Na誰ve Bayes had the lowest accuracy with 28%.

## Implementation
The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as SpaCy for NLP and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

## Usage
To run the code, open the Jupyter Notebook `SETH_ARMOH(B01665924)_F.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially. Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed.
